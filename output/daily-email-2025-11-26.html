The feature comes as an alternative to the company’s chatbots, which are no longer accessible to users under 18 as of this week. The change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors,…</div></li>

OpenAI announced on Tuesday it is updating the user interface to its popular AI chatbot so users can access ChatGPT Voice right inside their chat, instead of having to switch to a separate mode. That means you’ll be able to converse with the chatbot and view its responses, including things like shared images, as you talk. Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice. That screen also had a mute button and an option to record live video,…</div></li>

WMG said in a press release that the deal with Suno will “open new frontiers in music creation, interaction, and discovery, while both compensating and protecting artists, songwriters, and the wider creative community.” WMG also announced that it has sold Songkick, a live music and concert-discovery platform, to Suno for an undisclosed amount. WMG had acquired Songkick’s app and brand in 2017, while Live Nation later acquired Songkick’s ticketing business. WMG says Songkick will continue as…</div></li>

The tools are markedly similar to one another. OpenAI suggests that users could ask ChatGPT for help finding a “new laptop suitable for gaming under $1000 with a screen that’s over 15 inches,” or they can share photos of a high-end garment and ask for something similar at a lower price point. Perplexity, meanwhile, is playing up how its chatbot’s memory can augment shopping-related searches for its users, suggesting that someone could…</div></li>

Now he’s empowering young people to pursue their passions through his career exploration platform, Find Your Grind. The platform highlights alternative professions not usually emphasized in schools, including being a pop-punk band member, content creator, social media manager, and even a professional esports player. The company announced on Tuesday a $5 million Series A funding round, bringing its total funding to $8 million. The round was led by Echo Investment Capital, with support from Gross’ investment firm,…</div></li>

The company, which has about 961 robotaxis in the fleet today, announced the goal during its third-quarter earnings. Pony.ai is targeting a 1,000-robotaxi vehicle fleet by the end of this year. Its goal is to “surpass” 3,000 vehicles by the end of 2026, the company said in its third-quarter earnings report.

The recognition stems from the Code on Social Security — one of four labor laws the Indian government brought into effect on Friday, more than five years after the parliament first passed them in 2020. It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers,…</div></li>

On Tuesday, Accel and Google announced a partnership to jointly invest up to $2 million in each startup through Accel’s Atoms program, with both firms contributing up to $1 million. The 2026 cohort will focus on founders in India and the Indian diaspora building AI products from day one. “The thought process is building AI products for billions of Indians, as well as supporting AI products built in India for global markets,” Prayank…</div></li>

The device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless” and pocket-sized. Earlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io, to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their…</div></li>

The feature had a tenuous rollout — Martin Luther King Jr.’s estate had to get involved, to give you an idea of what went on — but now it faces a new challenge. Apparently, Cameo — the app where you buy custom video messages from celebrities — can claim the trademark of the word “cameo.” U.S. District Judge Eumi K. Lee imposed a temporary restraining order that blocks OpenAI from using the word “cameo,” as well as any similar-sounding words…</div></li></ol><a class="btn cta" href="#" style="background:#355E3B;color:#fff">Read all articles on web</a></div><div class="foot"><div style="padding-top:12px;border-top:1px solid #f0f0f0"><p style="margin:6px 0">You received this email because you subscribed to AI Investor Daily — curated AI investing insights.</p><p style="margin:6px 0">Copyright AI Investor Daily</p></div></div></div></center></body></html>
