Although consumers quickly adopted general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT, most specialized consumer GenAI applications have yet to resonate. “A lot of early AI applications around video, audio, and photo were super cool,” said Chi-Hua Chien, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital, onstage at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event in early December. “But then Sora and Nano Banana came out, and the Chinese open sourced their video models. And so, a lot of those opportunities disappeared.” Chien compares some of…</div></li>

The round was led by General Catalyst and Oak HC/FT, the company said. Other participants include Menlo Ventures, OpenAI, Dimension, Thrive Capital, Neo, Yosemite venture fund, Lachy Groom, SV Angel, and new investors Glade Brook and Emerson Collective. The firm’s total funding now stands at over $225 million. The company is one in a growing industry that sees AI as a faster route toward drug development.

The semiconductor giant announced Monday it acquired SchedMD, the leading developer of popular open source workload management system Slurm. Nvidia said the company will continue to operate the program, which is designed for high-performance computing and AI, as an open source, vendor-neutral software. Slurm was originally launched in 2002 and SchedMD was founded in 2010 by the lead Slurm developers Morris Jette and Danny Auble. Auble is the current CEO of SchedMD. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Nvidia declined…</div></li>

Creative Commons (CC) is best known for spearheading the licensing movement that allows creators to share their works while retaining copyright. In July, the organization announced a plan to provide a legal and technical framework for dataset sharing between companies that control the data and the AI providers that want to train on it.

The latest huge capital haul has come to Lightspeed Venture Partners. The 25-year-old venture firm announced Monday that it raised a total of $9 billion in fresh funds, the largest fundraise in firm’s history. At a time when very few companies have managed to IPO, Lightspeed was an early investor…</div></li>

Launched initially about a year and a half ago, this tool aimed to help users monitor their personal information on the dark web. For some users, the dark web report seemed like a valuable tool, scanning various data breach dumps and alerting them if their personal information — such as email addresses, names, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers —was found in compromised databases. However, as noted on its support page, Google has decided to shut down the feature due to feedback suggesting that…</div></li>

The company is also allowing free users to access the assistant’s features, such as summarizing the meetings, listing action items, or getting insights from meetings with limits. The company said that basic plan users get to use the AI companion within three meetings every month, which will each include a meeting summary, in-meeting questions, and AI note-taking capabilities. Plus, they can ask 20 questions each through the side panel and the new web surface. They can also purchase a $10 add-on plan to…</div></li>

And it’s doing that by way of an AI companion app: Called Momo Self Care, the app offers a digital pet called Momo that you can take care of, and in return, it’ll remind you to complete habit-building tasks. Users can set up reminders for what tasks they want to complete, and Momo will remind you of them. Similar to the hit productivity app Focus Friend,…</div></li>
