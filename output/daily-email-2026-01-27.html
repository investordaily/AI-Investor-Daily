On average, daily smartphone use exceeds three hours, and for many adults, total screen time climbs to six hours or more, according to research. This constant close-up screen exposure has been linked to a growing list of eye-health issues, including dry and irritated eyes, eye fatigue, blurred vision, headaches, and the worsening of nearsightedness, per reports. Edenlux, a South Korea–headquartered startup, has developed technology to address eye and ear health issues caused by screen-heavy digital lifestyles. The company’s mission is personal.

The extension values SpotDraft at around $380 million, the startup told TechCrunch, nearly double its $190 million post-money valuation following its $56 million Series B in February of last year. Across regulated sectors, enterprises have moved quickly to test generative AI, but privacy, security, and data governance concerns continue to slow adoption for sensitive workflows — especially in…</div></li>

Google did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement of the class-action case, which accused the firm of “unlawful and intentional interception and recording of individuals’ confidential communications without their consent and subsequent unauthorized disclosure of those communications to third parties.” The suit further claimed that “information gleaned from these recordings was wrongly transmitted to third parties for targeted advertising and for other purposes.” The case centered on “false accepts,” wherein Google Assistant is alleged to…</div></li>

The company said Monday the round was led by Lightspeed. Ricursive says the system will be able to create its own silicon substrate layer and speed up AI chip improvements. Rinse and repeat to get to AGI, the founders say. The Series A comes just two months since the company formally launched with a seed investment led by Sequoia. It has raised $335 million total, reports The New York Times. Ricursive was founded by former Google…</div></li>

Now, founders Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles are tasked with a bigger challenge: showing customers and investors how this AI-powered software layer translates to real savings on an industrial scale. The New York-based startup has had some success following its pre-seed funding round last July. Its system is now running with real customers, including public utilities, advanced manufacturing facilities, and chemical producers. It’s given the duo more concrete examples of what problems they can solve — and money they can save — for their big industry clients.…</div></li>

The 200, which follows the company’s Maia 100 released in 2023, has been technically outfitted to run powerful AI models at faster speeds and with more efficiency, the company has said. Maia comes equipped with over 100 billion transistors, delivering over 10 petaflops in 4-bit precision and approximately 5 petaflops of 8-bit performance — a substantial increase over its predecessor. Inference refers to the computing process of running a model, in contrast with the compute…</div></li>

On Friday, OpenAI engineer Michael Bolin published a detailed technical breakdown of how the company’s Codex CLI coding agent works internally, offering developers insight into AI coding tools that can write code, run tests, and fix bugs with human supervision. It complements our article in December on how AI agents work by filling in technical details on how OpenAI implements its “agentic loop.” AI coding agents are having something of a “ChatGPT moment,” where Claude Code with Opus 4.5 and Codex with GPT-5.2 have reached a new level of…</div></li>

The plaintiffs — internet content creators behind a trio of YouTube channels with roughly 6.2 million collective subscribers — allege that Snap has trained its AI systems on their video content for use in AI features like the app’s “Imagine Lens,” which allows users to edit images using text prompts. The plaintiffs earlier filed similar lawsuits against Nvidia, Meta, and ByteDance over similar matters.
