Doist, the company behind Todoist, a popular to-do list app that works across multiple devices, is launching its new AI-powered, “voice-to-tasks” feature: Todoist Ramble. The feature allows you to describe your tasks using natural language. True to its name, Ramble can take your meandering, unstructured speech and turn it into organized tasks. The app will also capture other details you mention, like project deadlines, priorities, duration, and assignees. The idea is that people often think of things they need to do while on the go, but…</div></li>

For years, Anthropic has sought to distinguish itself from its competitors via what it calls “Constitutional AI,” a system whereby its chatbot, Claude, is trained using a specific set of ethical principles rather than human feedback. Anthropic first published those principles — Claude’s Constitution —…</div></li>

The company found 100 hallucinated citations across 51 papers that it confirmed as fake, the company tells TechCrunch. Having a paper accepted by NeurIPS is a résumé-worthy achievement in the world of AI. Given that these are the leading minds of AI research, one might assume they would use LLMs for the catastrophically boring task of writing citations. So caveats abound with this finding: 100 confirmed hallucinated citations across 51 papers is not…</div></li>

She’s joining Acrew Capital as a general partner, working alongside founding partner Lauren Kolodny and the firm’s other partners, Rosenthal and Kolodny tell TechCrunch. Rosenthal left OpenAI about eight months ago after a three-year sprint at the AI lab that saw the launch of DALL·E, ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, Sora, and other products. “I wasn’t initially looking to join a VC fund,” she told TechCrunch. “I was out there meeting with lots of AI startups.” But after growing OpenAI’s enterprise sales team from two people to hundreds, she…</div></li>

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced on Wednesday that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using their own likeness. “This year you’ll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,” Mohan wrote in his annual letter. “Throughout this evolution, AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.” Shorts, which Mohan said now averages 200 billion daily views, is one of YouTube’s most popular mediums.

While the company is tight-lipped about the upcoming product, OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane said in an Axios-hosted panel at Davos the AI startup is on track to announce its first hardware device in the second half of this year. Last November, Sam Altman described the potential device to be more “peaceful and calm” than iPhones. Previous reporting suggests the company wants to build a screen-free and pocketable device.

Should the rumored device come to market, it would mark another sign that the AI hardware market is heating up.

His sources say that the Siri chatbot, which would be integrated into iOS 27, could be the focal point of Apple’s WWDC presentation in June. The Siri chatbot, internally codenamed “Campos,” will work with both voice and text inputs. Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi had previously stated that he didn’t want Siri to be a chatbot, and rather, that he wanted Apple’s AI options to be “integrated so it’s there within reach whenever you need…</div></li></ol><a class="btn cta" href="#" style="background:#355E3B;color:#fff">Read all articles on web</a></div><div class="foot"><div style="padding-top:12px;border-top:1px solid #f0f0f0"><p style="margin:6px 0">You received this email because you subscribed to AI Investor Daily — curated AI investing insights.</p><p style="margin:6px 0">Copyright AI Investor Daily</p></div></div></div></center></body></html>
