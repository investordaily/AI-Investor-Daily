I didn’t opt for an Apple Watch because I wasn’t constantly active, I didn’t feel the need to check my notifications, and I didn’t want to think about charging the watch every day. This year, I got a chance to test the new Google Pixel Watch 4, which made me feel like I might start wearing smartwatches again. I have always had a soft spot for circular watches. One of the first smartwatches I owned was the Moto 360,…</div></li>

In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that AI models are “starting to present some real challenges,” including the “potential impact of models on mental health,” as well as models that are “so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities.” “If you want to help the world figure out how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can’t use them for harm, ideally by making all systems…</div></li>

Bloomberg reports that influencers known as Adapt, Jason, Ronaldo, Lacy, Rage, and Silky — the entire roster on the FaZe Clan website — all announced that they are leaving the group. Adapt wrote on X that he’d spent 14 years as part of FaZe Clan: “Over half of my life, I’d be lying if I said this didn’t hurt, but it had to be done.” Another FaZe Clan member who left in August had described the situation as one where the…</div></li>

The goalposts have moved, the stakes are higher, and investors seem pickier than ever as the AI boom reshapes the industry. At TechCrunch Disrupt, three investors — Thomas Green of Insight Partners, Moxxie Ventures’ Katie Stanton, and GV’s Sangeen Zeb — broke down what they’ll be looking for in the new year. The numbers tell a clear story. Fewer rounds are getting funded but deal sizes have grown, said Green citing a study. “It has never been easier to start a company, and it has never been harder to…</div></li>

Now, nearly four years later, the insect farming company has been placed into judicial liquidation — essentially bankruptcy — for insolvency. The company’s demise is hardly a surprise, as Ÿnsect had been embattled for months. Still, there is plenty to unpack about how a startup can go bankrupt despite raising over $600 million, including from Downey Jr.’s FootPrint Coalition, taxpayers, and many others. Ultimately, Ÿnsect failed to fulfill its ambition to “revolutionize the food…</div></li>

As first spotted by the Google Pixel Hub group on Telegram and subsequently reported in 9to5Google, a Hindi version of the Gmail support website states that Google is “gradually rolling out to all users” the ability to change the email address tied to their Google account, including changing from their current Gmail address to “to a new email address that ends in gmail.com.” If you make the switch, your old…</div></li>

However, when she looked down at her feet, she saw that the white sandy beach was covered with plastic debris, most of which was from plastic bottles. After many years in the business world as the cofounder of an environmental software company, the experience inspired Sajedi to become a researcher. She had always had a passion for waste reduction, but she realized that the problem was consumption itself. Thus, as a doctoral student at Concordia University in Canada, Sajedi reviewed…</div></li>
