The camera pans to a man earnestly asking a chatbot (obviously intended to depict ChatGPT) for advice on how to talk to his mom. The bot, portrayed by a blonde woman, offers some classic bits of advice. Start by listening. Try a nature walk! And then twists into an ad for a fictitious (we hope!) cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters. Anthropic finishes the spot by saying that while ads are coming to AI, they won’t be…</div></li>

With former employees who went on to create dozens of startups, the fintech company has become one of the most prolific “founder factories” — and the money is following. The latest example: business identity verification startup Duna, which just raised a €30 million Series A to become the best-funded European member of the so-called “Stripe mafia.” The funding round was led by Alphabet’s growth fund CapitalG, which has also backed Stripe since co-leading its Series D…</div></li>

Instead of responding to an analyst’s question about how the tech giant is thinking about AI partnerships, such as the one with Apple to power AI for Siri, the question was completely ignored. That decision tells us something, though — Alphabet isn’t ready to talk about how this partnership will impact its core business, which is increasingly focused on AI. Over the years, the Google-Apple relationship has been mutually beneficial. The two companies’ search partnership saw the search giant…</div></li>

The round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation of existing investors including Greylock Partners, Unusual Ventures, Artisanal Ventures, and A*. The announcement confirms TechCrunch’s December report that the startup was raising at a billion-dollar valuation led by Lightspeed. Sources told TechCrunch at the time that the round may have consisted of multiple tranches, at different prices, which could have put the company’s actual blended valuation below $1 billion.

According to a report from Reuters, those tools are now ready to move beyond internal testing. Amazon will begin a closed beta program in March, inviting industry partners to try out its AI tools. Amazon said it anticipates sharing initial outcomes from the program by May. The company chose not to provide further details on the developments when approached by TechCrunch for a…</div></li>

Startup Lunar Energy is the latest example. The six-year-old company, which builds battery packs for homeowners in California, Georgia, and Washington, said Wednesday it has completed two large funding rounds. The startup shared it raised a previously unannounced $130 million Series C and a $102 million Series D. The Series C was led by Activate Capital, while the Series D was led by B Capital and Prelude Ventures. The startup plans to use the funds to scale manufacturing to 20,000 units by the…</div></li>

The company claims the tool, called Cube 3D, has so far helped users generate over 1.8 million 3D objects since it was rolled out last March. On Wednesday, the company launched the open beta for its anticipated 4D creation feature that lets creators make not just static 3D models, but fully functional and interactive objects. The feature has been in early access since November. Roblox says 4D creation adds an important…</div></li>

Sequoia partner Andrew Reed is joining the company’s board. The startup is now valued at $11 billion, more than three times its valuation in its last round in January 2025. Earlier in the year, the Financial Times reported that the startup was looking to raise at that valuation. The company said that existing investor a16z quadrupled its investment amount, and Iconiq, which led the last round, tripled it.…</div></li>

The company’s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy. In Q4, Snap’s revenue was $1.7 billion, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company’s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows.
