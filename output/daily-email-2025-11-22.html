Some of these AI wearables — including necklaces, rings, and wristbands, as well as portable devices — serve as productivity tools, while others claim to act as friendly companions listening to your everyday thoughts.

On Thursday, Salesforce disclosed a breach of “certain customers’ Salesforce data” — without naming affected companies — that was stolen via apps published by Gainsight, which provides a customer support platform to other companies. In a statement, Austin Larsen, the principal threat analyst of Google Threat Intelligence Group, said that the company “is aware of more than 200 potentially affected Salesforce instances.” After Salesforce announced the breach, the notorious and somewhat-nebulous hacking group known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which…</div></li>

Digital fraud continues to rise in India as more people come online for the first time and increasingly rely on smartphones for payments, shopping, and accessing government services. Fraud involving digital transactions accounted for more than half of all reported bank fraud in 2024 — 13,516 cases resulting in losses of ₹5.2 billion (about $58.61 million), according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Online scams caused an estimated ₹70 billion (roughly…</div></li>

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Superior Court of California in Santa Cruz County, makes a series of allegations against Archer and George Kivork, a former Joby employee. Joby alleges Kivork, who was hired by Archer, stole trade secrets that were then used by Archer. In the lawsuit, Joby alleges that two days before announcing his resignation, Kivork “exfiltrated a cache of highly valuable Joby filings containing confidential partnerships terms, business and…</div></li>

The round comes less than two months after the seven-year-old startup announced its previous fundraise of $300 million at a $5 billion valuation. The latest round is led by the company’s returning investors Sequoia and CapitalG, the person said. Other investors in Kalshi include Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, Anthos Capital, and Neo.

In a notice published late Wednesday, Salesforce said the hacks involve “Gainsight-published applications connected to Salesforce, which are installed and managed directly by customers.” Salesforce said that there is “no indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,” and that the activity appears related to Gainsight’s “external connection to Salesforce.” When reached for comment, Salesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda referred TechCrunch to…</div></li>

The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. The feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or co-workers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions.
