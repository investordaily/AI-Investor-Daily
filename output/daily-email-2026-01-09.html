As has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We’ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still…</div></li>

In this season finale episode of Build Mode, our guest has an answer: Startups have focused too much on product development and not enough on distribution excellence. Paul Irving is partner and COO at GTMfund, which operates under the thesis that distribution is the final moat in the AI era. The traditional go-to-market playbook lays out a one-size-fits-all approach to hiring and scaling that may have worked in the days of traditional enterprise SaaS but…</div></li>

While the report contains promises to respect human rights and have controls to demand its customers do the same, the report provides no concrete evidence supporting either. Experts and critics who have followed NSO and the spyware…</div></li>

The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting. An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal. Convogo’s product will be…</div></li>

The chipmaker isn’t leaving any room for refunds or changes to orders, the report said. While some customers may be allowed to use commercial insurance or asset collateral, the terms are far stricter than Nvidia’s earlier policies, which sometimes permitted partial deposits, Reuters reported. Nvidia declined to comment. China is expected to allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips in the country, per Bloomberg, though Beijing wants to…</div></li>

Paul shares specific, actionable advice on how early-stage startups can win even when facing well-funded competitors who iterate at lightning speed. He also explains why distribution has become the final remaining moat when technical advantages disappear in months instead of years, and why every company needs a unique go-to-market motion tailored to their specific ICP. They also dive into the power of warm-introduction mapping and building authentic relationships with operators who can open…</div></li>

Musk sued OpenAI and its co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman in 2024, alleging they betrayed their original contractual agreements by pursuing profits instead of the nonprofit’s founding mission to develop AI that benefits humanity. Musk, who has launched his own for-profit company xAI, was an early financial backer and co-founder of OpenAI. He resigned from the board in 2018 after his bid to take over as CEO was rejected by the other co-founders, who put Altman up…</div></li>

A member of a Special Response Team, ICE’s version of a SWAT team, he’s had duties as a firearms trainer and led teams drawn from multiple federal agencies including the FBI, Ross testified.
