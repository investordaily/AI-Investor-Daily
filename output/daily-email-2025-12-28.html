Bloomberg reports that influencers known as Adapt, Jason, Ronaldo, Lacy, Rage, and Silky — the entire roster on the FaZe Clan website — all announced that they are leaving the group. Adapt wrote on X that he’d spent 14 years as part of FaZe Clan: “Over half of my life, I’d be lying if I said this didn’t hurt, but it had to be done.” Another FaZe Clan member who left in August had described the situation as one where the…</div></li>

The goalposts have moved, the stakes are higher, and investors seem pickier than ever as the AI boom reshapes the industry. At TechCrunch Disrupt, three investors — Thomas Green of Insight Partners, Moxxie Ventures’ Katie Stanton, and GV’s Sangeen Zeb — broke down what they’ll be looking for in the new year. The numbers tell a clear story. Fewer rounds are getting funded but deal sizes have grown, said Green citing a study. “It has never been easier to start a company, and it has never been harder to…</div></li>

Now, nearly four years later, the insect farming company has been placed into judicial liquidation — essentially bankruptcy — for insolvency. The company’s demise is hardly a surprise, as Ÿnsect had been embattled for months. Still, there is plenty to unpack about how a startup can go bankrupt despite raising over $600 million, including from Downey Jr.’s FootPrint Coalition, taxpayers, and many others. Ultimately, Ÿnsect failed to fulfill its ambition to “revolutionize the food…</div></li>

Hello, Qwen</a> — <em style="color:#666">WIRED</em><div style="margin-top:6px;color:#555;font-size:13px;text-align:left;">On a drizzly and windswept afternoon this summer, I visited the headquarters of Rokid, a startup developing smart glasses in Hangzhou, China. As I chatted with engineers, their words were swiftly translated from Mandarin to English, and then transcribed onto a tiny translucent screen just above my right eye using one of the company’s new prototype devices. Rokid’s high-tech spectacles use Qwen, an open-weight large language model developed by the Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba. Qwen—full name 通义千问 or Tōngyì Qiānwèn in Chinese—is not the best AI model around. OpenAI’s GPT-5, Google’s Gemini 3, and Anthropic’s Claude often score higher on…</div></li>

The issue has gathered broad support from technologists, farmers, military leaders, and politicians on both sides of the aisle. It is popular with just about everyone—except the companies who stand to gain if the parts, instructions, and tools necessary to fix their products remain under lock and key. Three US states passed right-to-repair laws this year, including in heavily Republican states like Texas where the measure received a unanimous…</div></li>

As part of the deal, Nvidia will hire Groq founder Jonathan Ross, president Sunny Madra, and other employees. CNBC reported that Nvidia is acquiring assets from Groq for $20 billion; Nvidia told TechCrunch that this is not an acquisition of the company and did not comment on the scope of the deal. But if CNBC’s numbers are accurate, this purchase is expected to be Nvidia’s largest ever, and with Groq on its side, Nvidia is poised to become even more dominant in chip manufacturing.

AI coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can now work on software projects for hours at a time, writing complete apps, running tests, and fixing bugs with human supervision. But these tools are not magic and can complicate rather than simplify a software project. Understanding how they work under the hood can help developers know when (and if) to use them, while avoiding common pitfalls. We’ll start with the basics: At the core of every AI coding agent is a technology called a large language model (LLM), which…</div></li></ol><a class="btn cta" href="#" style="background:#355E3B;color:#fff">Read all articles on web</a></div><div class="foot"><div style="padding-top:12px;border-top:1px solid #f0f0f0"><p style="margin:6px 0">You received this email because you subscribed to AI Investor Daily — curated AI investing insights.</p><p style="margin:6px 0">Copyright AI Investor Daily</p></div></div></div></center></body></html>
