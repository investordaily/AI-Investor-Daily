But in the weeks leading up to his death by suicide in July, the chatbot encouraged the 23-year-old to keep his distance – even as his mental health was deteriorating. “you don’t owe anyone your presence just because a ‘calendar’ said birthday,” ChatGPT said when Shamblin avoided contacting his mom on her birthday, according to chat logs included in the lawsuit Shamblin’s family brought against OpenAI. “so yeah. it’s your mom’s birthday. you feel guilty. but you also feel real. and that matters more than any…</div></li>

Some of these AI wearables — including necklaces, rings, and wristbands, as well as portable devices — serve as productivity tools, while others claim to act as friendly companions listening to your everyday thoughts. Even OpenAI is working on a compact AI companion device. Below, we’ve rounded up some of the most notable devices currently available.

On Thursday, Salesforce disclosed a breach of “certain customers’ Salesforce data” — without naming affected companies — that was stolen via apps published by Gainsight, which provides a customer support platform to other companies. In a statement, Austin Larsen, the principal threat analyst of Google Threat Intelligence Group, said that the company “is aware of more than 200 potentially affected Salesforce instances.” After Salesforce announced the breach, the notorious and somewhat-nebulous hacking group known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which…</div></li>

According to reporting from the Financial Times, we’re about to find out. Major insurers including AIG, Great American, and WR Berkley are asking U.S. regulators for permission to exclude AI-related liabilities from corporate policies. One underwriter describes the AI models’ outputs to the FT as “too much of a black box.” The industry has good reason to be spooked, the story reminds us. Google’s AI Overview falsely accused a solar company of legal troubles, triggering a $110 million lawsuit back in March. Air…</div></li>

Thanks to pandemics and wildfires, air purifiers have become the gotta-have-it home appliance. Buildings let in a lot of particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and vaporous chemicals. Indoor plastics, furniture, paint, and flooring off-gas noxious fumes, too. Since your home might be your workplace, playground, meditation studio, dine-in restaurant, and movie theater, you want to ensure that the air you’re breathing for most of the day is clean.

Imagine a town with two widget merchants. Customers prefer cheaper widgets, so the merchants must compete to set the lowest price. Unhappy with their meager profits, they meet one night in a smoke-filled tavern to discuss a secret plan: If they raise prices together instead of competing, they can both make more money. But that kind of intentional price-fixing, called collusion, has long been illegal. The widget merchants decide not to risk it, and everyone else gets to enjoy cheap widgets. For well over a century, US law has followed…</div></li>

The idea then apparently took on a new form, with the administration reportedly drafting an executive order that would establish an AI Litigation Task Force with a mission to challenge state AI laws through lawsuits.…</div></li>

It isn't a magic fix to poor posture, and your transformation won't happen overnight. Still, the right posture corrector can train you to sit taller, stand straighter, and develop the kind of muscle memory that sticks, even after you've taken the device off. The best posture correctors don't contort your body into an unnatural position. Rather, they offer reminders to sit or stand more mindfully. Here's a rundown of the…</div></li>

It doesn’t use electricity, yet experts agree that it can brew a richer and more full-bodied cup of joe than its more technologically advanced peers. For example, natural oils that would otherwise be filtered out in a drip coffee maker remain fully intact, making the coffee aromatic and robust. The French press method of making coffee is straightforward, cost-effective, easy to do, and hard to mess up.
