Details of the Tuesday night meeting were previously reported by The New York Times, which may have influenced xAI’s decision to post the video online. The full video reveals significant new details about Musk’s plans for the AI lab, including its product roadmap and its ongoing ties to the X platform. Since xAI was formed just 30 months ago, the small and talented team has made remarkable progress.The future has never looked more exciting! pic.twitter.com/QZ73H2mpBj The most immediate revelation…</div></li>

Should the deal close at these terms, the funding round would more than double the company’s valuation of $1.1 billion announced less than five months ago, when it announced an $87 million Series B round. General Catalyst is in talks to lead the round, the people told TechCrunch. Modal’s annualized revenue run rate (ARR) is approximately $50 million, our sources said. The discussions are early, and terms…</div></li>

At the same time, the team’s former leader has been given a new role as the company’s “chief futurist.” OpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch that the team’s members have now been assigned to other roles. The news was first reported by Platformer. The disbanded team in question appears to have been formed in September of 2024. Platformer reports that the team was dedicated to promoting “the company’s stated mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.” An…</div></li>

The beta version is now available in the app.​ To use the new chatbot, users search for a grocery store in the Uber Eats app and tap the purple Cart Assistant icon on the store’s page to begin shopping. Customers can enter a list or upload an image of one, and Cart Assistant will automatically add the necessary items to their basket. This includes photos of handwritten lists or screenshots of recipes and their ingredients. Users can then customize the…</div></li>

At an all-hands meeting Tuesday night, Musk suggested the exits were about fit, not performance. “Because we’ve reached a certain scale, we’re organizing the company to be more effective at this scale,” he said, according to The New York Times. “And actually, when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.” Wednesday afternoon on X, he went…</div></li>

The feature allows app users to send payments via a hyperlink that can be attached to a variety of communications. Users can access the links by taking the typical steps in Cash App’s payment tab, but instead of clicking “add recipient,” the user now has the option to click “share link.” Choosing this will create a link that can subsequently be added to texts, emails, and DMs as…</div></li>

Elon Musk and his coterie have been talking about AI in space for years — mainly in the context of Iain Banks’ science-fiction series about a far-future universe where sentient spaceships roam and control the galaxy. Now Musk sees an opportunity to realize a version of this vision. His company SpaceX has requested regulatory permission to build solar-powered orbital data centers, distributed across as many as a million satellites, that could shift as much as 100 GW of compute power off the planet. He has reportedly suggested some of his AI satellites…</div></li>

The platform’s new “Dear Algo” feature lets users tell Threads what they temporarily want to see more or less of in their feed. To use the feature, users need to type “Dear Algo” in a public Threads post, followed by what they’d like to see more or less of. For example, if you want to see more content about popular podcasts, you can post “Dear Algo, show me more posts about podcasts.” Your feed will be adjusted for three days after…</div></li>

After a long stretch on GitHub Copilot, Silver is now a corporate vice president at Microsoft’s CoreAI division, where she works on tools for deploying apps and agentic systems within enterprises. Her work is focused on the Foundry system inside Azure, which is designed as a unified AI portal for enterprises, giving her a close view of how companies are actually using these systems and where deployments end up falling short.

Inertia Enterprises is building on technology developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF). The NIF is the site of the world’s only controlled fusion reactions that have reached scientific breakeven, in which the reaction releases more energy than it took to start.
